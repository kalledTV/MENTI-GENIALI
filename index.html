      <p>The world economy is a complex and dynamic system that encompasses the economic activity of all countries around the globe. It includes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, as well as the transfer of money and other financial assets among countries. The global economy has grown significantly in recent years, with increased trade and investment, but it has also faced challenges such as financial crises and economic inequality.

Economic growth is often measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. The global GDP has been growing at an average rate of about 3% per year over the past decade. However, this growth has been unevenly distributed among countries and regions, with some experiencing much faster growth than others.

Trade is a major driver of the world economy, with countries buying and selling goods and services to each other. The value of international trade has been growing rapidly in recent years, with countries increasingly specializing in the production of certain goods and services and trading them with other countries. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the main international organization that monitors and regulates international trade.

The financial sector also plays a crucial role in the world economy, with banks, investment firms, and other financial institutions facilitating the movement of money and other financial assets among countries. However, the financial sector has also been a source of instability, with several financial crises occurring in recent years, such as the 2008 global financial crisis.

In addition to economic growth and trade, the world economy also encompasses issues related to poverty, inequality, and the environment. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are among the main organizations that provide analysis and funding for economic development in less developed countries. The United Nations and other international organizations also play a role in addressing global economic issues.

Overall, the world economy is a complex and constantly changing system that is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic policies, technological advancements, and natural disasters. It is closely watched and analyzed by governments, businesses, and international organizations to help inform policy and investment decisions.</p>

      <h2>UKRAINE IN WAR</h2><img src="https://www.rivistailmulino.it/main/file/inline/f/c92383002f757cddd52df84e68894b5e" width="300" height="200">
      <p>The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in 2014. The conflict originated from the political crisis in Ukraine that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by of Russia.

The crisis started in 2013, when Yanukovych decided not to sign an association agreement with the European Union, in favor of an agreement with Russia. This led to protests in the streets of Kiev, which were violently repressed by government forces. In February 2014, Yanukovych was deposed and a caretaker government was formed.

Russia reacted to Yanukovych's overthrow by invading and clouding Crimea, a Russian-majority region of Ukraine. The annexation of Crimea has been condemned by the international community and has led to the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia.

After the annexation of Crimea, Russian-backed pro-Russian separatist groups in eastern Ukraine started a rebellion against the Ukrainian government. The situation escalated into an armed conflict with sporadic clashes and violence. Despite various ceasefire and peace agreements, the conflict continues and has claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people.

The international community has condemned Russia for its role in the conflict and has imposed economic sanctions against it. Relations between Russia and the West have been significantly deteriorated as a result of the crisis.</p>
